## What is Computational Thinking
Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions. We can then present these solutions in a way that a computer, a human, or both, can understand.

### The four cornerstones of computational thinking
There are four key techniques (cornerstones) to computational thinking:

- decomposition: breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts

- pattern recognition: looking for similarities among and within problems

- abstraction: focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant detail

- algorithms: developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem
  
**Each cornerstone is as important as the others. They are like legs on a table - if one leg is missing, the table will probably collapse. Correctly applying all four techniques will help when programming a computer.**

## What's a Data  Structure?
A named location that can be used to store and organise data.  
Examples are:
- Trees
- Array: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.

## What's an Algorithm?
A set of steps or instructions for completing a task.  

## Characteristics of an Algorithm
- An alogrithm must have a clearly defined problem statement, input, and output.
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.
- The steps of the algorithm needs to be distinct.
- The algorithm should produce a result.
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.
